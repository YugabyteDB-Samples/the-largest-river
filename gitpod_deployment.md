## Once Gitpod Environment Started

Once the environment is ready, the application will get connected to a three-node YugabyteDB cluster. 

First, you can explore the application by openining the address for port `3000`. You should get a Gitpod notification once the port is ready:

Second, the YugabyteDB management and monitoring UI will be listening on port `7000`. Open the Gitpod address assigned for this port, to explore the cluster's state and metrics:
